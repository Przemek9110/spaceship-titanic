# SPACESHIP TITANIC
The Spaceship Titanic project is an analysis of data related to the fictional space accident that occurred on the Titanic spaceship. The goal of the project is to use machine learning algorithms to predict which passengers will be rescued during the disaster.

## Project description
The project consists of analyzing a dataset containing information about the passengers and crew of the Titanic spacecraft that crashed. The data includes information such as age, gender, ticket class and cabin number. The goal of the project is to use machine learning algorithms to predict which passengers will be rescued during the disaster.

The project uses four machine learning algorithms: CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM and simple Logistic Regression in the PyTorch library. This made it possible to compare the effectiveness of different models in predicting which passengers would be rescued.

## Installation and startup instructions
To run the project, clone the repository from GitHub. 

## Authors
The project was developed by Przemyslaw Kwiecinski.
